# Mania, Memes, and Madess!
Hello, and welcome to my website! I hope you love video games, as we have some great games to break into today! I want to use a mixture of images and words to convey my high respect for these items and what they can represent! The one term I really want to go over is what I see as the gaming divide; but more importantly, MEMES AND FUN! No, Fortnite isn't everyone's favorite game, (actually maybe it might be), and yes Minecraft good and Fortnite bad.

## The Games
Video games are seen in many different lights, we have the obsessed gamers, who can't seem to live without that new Fortnite pickaxe, or that pro, who lives, breathes, and dies in their basement playing League of Legends, but there are also casual games, who always love to play as the games provide a relief from the problems of life. More importantly the issue regarding the skill gap between each and every player that can make video games rot internally.

## Games that are Immune

To begin with we have games that are immune to this issue, AKA the Single Players! These games seem to always be the purest of games, where causal and competitive games can unite, to play a fun single-player adventure, like a **Mario Galaxy**, or a **Sonic Mania**. The reason why I bring these up, is that single player games are a core stone in gaming, as they fueled the juggernaut that is the industry we have today. Anyone can enjoy a well-made single player game. Galaxy and Mania are examples of video games at their finest, loved by all without a major divide in their fanbase.

## The Plagued Games
Multiplayer games, however have this issue plaguing them, like a parasite that grows as the game matures. One main example was the decline of Fortnite Battle Royale. In the beginning, the game was extremely fun, as anyone could play and learn and have fun. In Season 4, Epic Games released playground, a mode meant for fun with friends, but some people used the mode to practice and refine their skill, as you could build easily there. In season 7, creative was released, letting people practice with infinite items. These two led the skill gap to considerably widen between the casuals and competitive players. Epic Games tried to remedy this by adding extremely overpowered items, like the Infinity Blade, or B.R.U.T.E into the game, in hopes that this would level the skill gap between casuals and pros, but that just ruined comppetitive matches, and made the divided community even angrier. Later on they added skill based matchmaking and actual bots to the game to try to fix the issue, but it was too late. Fortnite's reputation was in ruins, and were never able to recover from its steep decline. On a happier note, Fortnite still has a considerable playerbase today, despite its fall from grace

## To Conclude
The politics and flaws of game are easier to observe as time goes on. Games can be much more complex than what they have upfront. The cycles of games can mirror each other in many ways. I find it fascinating, as I love video games, Fortnite may be an annoying example, and as much as it's hated, it went through the cycle and fell. I just hope you found elements of my article entertaining, and at the very least, laughed at the stupid memes and images I made! To end it off I just want to provide links with information of some of my favorite games of all time as those games are **Awesome!**
