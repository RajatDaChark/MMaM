# Mania, Memes, and Madess!
Hello, and welcome to my website! I hope you love video games, as we have some great games to break into today! I want to use a mixture of images and words to convey my high respect for these items and what they can represent! The one term I really want to go over is what I see as the gaming divide; but more importantly, MEMES AND FUN! No, Fortnite isn't everyone's favorite game, (actually maybe it might be), and yes Minecraft good and Fortnite bad.

## The Games
Video games are seen in many different lights, we have the obsessed gamers, who can't seem to live without that new Fortnite pickaxe, or that pro, who lives, breathes, and dies in their basement playing League of Legends, but there are also casual games, who always love to play as the games provide a relief from the problems of life. More importantly the issue regarding the skill gap between each and every player that can make video games rot internally.

## Games that are Immune

To begin with we have games that are immune to this issue, AKA the Single Players! These games seem to always be the purest of games, where causal and competitive games can unite, to play a fun single-player adventure, like a **Mario Galaxy**, or a **Sonic Mania**. The reason why I bring these up, is that single player games are a core stone in gaming, as they fueled the juggernaut that is the industry we have today. Anyone can enjoy a well-made single player game. Galaxy and Mania are examples of video games at their finest, loved by all without a major divide in their fanbase.

## The Plagued Games
Multiplayer games, however have this issue plaguing them, like a parasite that grows as the game matures. One main example was the decline of Fortnite Battle Royale. In the beginning, the game was extremely fun, as anyone could play and learn and have fun. In Season 4, Epic Games released playground, a mode meant for fun with friends, but some people used the mode to practice and refine thier skill, and the divide between the casuals and the pros began to grow.
