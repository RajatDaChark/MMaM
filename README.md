 Mania, Memes, and Madess!
Hello, and welcome to my website! I hope you love video games, as we have some great games to break into today! I want to use a mixture of images and words to convey my high respect for these items and what they can represent! The one term I really want to go over is what I see as the gaming divide; but more importantly, MEMES AND FUN! No, Fortnite isn't everyone's favorite game, (actually maybe it might be), and yes Minecraft good and Fortnite bad.

## The Games
Video games are seen in many different lights, we have the obsessed gamers, who can't seem to live without that new Fortnite pickaxe, or that pro, who lives, breathes, and dies in their basement playing League of Legends, but there are also casual games, who always love to play as the games provide a relief from the problems of life. More importantly the issue regarding the skill gap between each and every player that can make video games rot internally.
